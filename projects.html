    <section>
      <h2>Project One: The Garden.</h2>
      <p>Status: Ongoing.</p>
      <p>Remove all of the overgrowth that may encroach on the structure of the property. Remove the weeds, and provide a foundation for a beautiful garden.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Two: Replace broken back door.</h2>
       <p>Status: Completed.</p>
      <p>Provide improved security and water-tightness by replacing the broken PVC rear door. A tasteful hardwood door is fitted in the old door's place.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Three: Connect utilities.</h2>
       <p>Status: Completed.</p>
      <p>With the door affixed and major overgrowth removed from the outside of the property, the utilities can be connected to provide heat to the home.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Four: Address condensation damp and clean.</h2>
       <p>Status: Completed.</p>
      <p>Heat is added to the home, and ground level is reduced where possible. Black mould is addressed using chemical mould killer. With the mould mostly gone, it was time to clean the property.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Five: Kitchen Revival.</h2>
       <p>Status: Ongoing.</p>
      <p>Modern functionality meets heritage charm, featuring bespoke cabinetry and traditional tiling. The kitchen is stripped back to its bare bones for a new floor, plastered in lime, updated plumbing and electrics, then finally the kitchen.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Six: Relevel upstairs flooring, and remove/replace large chimney.</h2>
       <p>Status: To do.</p>
      <p>Whilst quirks of old buildings are certainly charming, an obnoxiously large chimney takes up too much floor space, leaks into the dining room, and is coated with asbestos. The upstairs flooring sags by over an inch. This will be a job for a contracted professional team.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Seven: Clean gutters and remove ivy.</h2>
       <p>Status: To do.</p>
      <p>Cleaning and repairing the guttering reduces the chance of further damp upstairs. Removing the ivy also prevents damage to the home. Better to address these jobs whilst the weather is preferable.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Eight: Upstairs bathroom renewal.</h2>
       <p>Status: To do.</p>
      <p>Strip back the old bathroom and replace old materials and fixtures. Modernise for comfort, but remain sensitive to the home's aesthetic.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Nine: Downstairs remodelling, extension side.</h2>
       <p>Status: To do.</p>
      <p>The downstairs bathroom, hallway, utility and cosy shall be replastered in lime and refloored. Any electrical or plumbing issues or additions that may help later on shall be made at this stage.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Ten: Downstairs remodelling, original side.</h2>
       <p>Status: To do.</p>
      <p>The downstairs dining room, living room and stairway shall be replastered in lime and refloored. Any electrical or plumbing issues or additions that may help later on shall be made at this stage.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Eleven: Upstairs remodelling.</h2>
       <p>Status: To do.</p>
      <p>The full scope of the upstairs remodel has not been truly thought out at this stage.</p>
    </section>
