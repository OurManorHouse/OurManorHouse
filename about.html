      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our Manor House stands as a quiet witness to centuries past — a home with history woven into its walls, timbers, and timeworn floors. Built long before modern conveniences, the house carries the quiet character of age: imperfect plaster, creaking boards, and handcrafted details shaped by generations of use. Rather than replace or erase these, we’re embracing them where we can, working room by room to revive the home’s original charm while making it liveable for a new era.</p>
      <p>Every decision is made with sensitivity to the building’s spirit. Whether it’s sourcing lime plaster, restoring fireplaces, or uncovering hidden details behind modern cladding, we’re choosing methods and materials that would feel familiar to the home’s first builders. Our goal isn’t a showroom-perfect finish, but a deeply personal one — each crack, brushstroke, and timber beam a quiet nod to the craftsmanship of the past.</p>
      <p>This renovation is not just about preserving a property, but telling its story. Through each video, photograph, and blog entry, we’re documenting both the beauty and the imperfections of restoring an old home with our own hands. It’s a project shaped by patience, research, mistakes, and small triumphs — and we’re glad to share the journey with you.</p>

      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>Paige: Never thought she would undertake a restoration project of such size, but has been heavily involved in both media and property businesses throughout her career. Managing multiple endeavours whilst also being a first-time mum, she is still keen to get 'on the tools' and try her hand at some of the trades.</p>
      <p>Tom: A project and process engineer by trade, with a solid portfolio of work within both the energy and oil and gas industries; this renovation project is far from the scale of projects he has designed, installed, and managed previously. This project, though, involves fewer experienced professionals, and is self-funded. No room for error!</p>

      <h3>The House</h3>
      <p>Built in 1609, the same year that Galileo Galilei invented the telescope, this property has seen over four centuries of faces and events, and has stood testament to the skill and worksmanship of the original builders. Towards the end of the English renaissance, in the year that would inspire 'The Tempest' by William Shakespeare, a Manor House was built that would also stand the test of time.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, a manor house was the residence of the Lord of the manor, serving as both a family home and the administrative centre of local estates. These houses were often built with locally sourced materials, and their design reflected both practical needs and social status. Typically, these properties would be accompanied with ample land. Over the years, this has been sold off for newer developments.</p>
      <p>Our Manor House is a rare example of 17th architecture that has maintained much of its beautiful originality without having current legislative limitations outside of standard building regulations and engineering codes. It is therefore possible to perform a tasteful restoration without significant red tape, providing we adhere to the ordinary legal requirements of property modifications.</p>
      <p>Architecturally, the house features a large fireplace, timber framing, and thick brick walls, characteristic of the period and region. The exposed beams, large hearth, and deep window sills not only tell a story of bygone days but also create a distinctive atmosphere that we are dedicated to enhancing.</p>
      <p>Left uninhabited for 6 years, these marvellous features were quietly reclaimed by nature. It is this period of vacancy that poses challenges and opportunities for restoration as we strive to breathe life back into its walls while honouring its past.</p>
      <p>Our Manor House, then, is more than just a building; it is a living piece of history - a symbol of heritage, culture, community, and continuity through the ages.</p>
