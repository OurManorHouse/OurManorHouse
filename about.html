      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We believe this house has the potential to make a beautiful family home, but it will take a lot of work! We intend to conduct work on the property tastefully, taking into account the age and heritage that the 1609 manor house bears.</p>

      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>Paige: Never thought she would undertake a restoration project of such size, but has been heavily involved in both media and property businesses throughout her career. Managing multiple endeavours whilst also being a first-time mum, she is still keen to get 'on the tools' and try her hand at some of the trades.</p>
      <p>Tom: A project and process engineer by trade, with a solid portfolio of work within both the energy and oil and gas industries; this renovation project is far from the scale of projects he has designed, installed, and managed previously. This project, though, involves fewer experienced professionals, and is self-funded. No room for error!</p>
